# Taking care of the installation process. The `install` stage is where you
# specify all the files that you want to ship with your software. It's being
# used as the basis for the `packaging` stage, and on Linux it can be used
# directly to install on `/usr/local/`, etc.
#
# You can run this either by running `make install` or  `cmake --install .`
# from the build/ directory.
#
# - On Linux and Flatpak, we can probably just use this, and don't
# bother with the packaging.
#       - For linux, the only thing that need to do is to set the
#         `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` correctly, something like `/opt/jasp`
#         and everything will work
