list(APPEND CMAKE_MESSAGE_CONTEXT Dependencies)

# If set, CMake tries to download all the necessary dependencies
#
#   - Boost, jsoncpp, and readstat

# Notes:
#
# - FetchContent variables will be lower cased, that's why we have
#   weird variable names like r_win_exe_POPULATED.
# - "CMake 3.22 updated the FindPkgConfig module to allow passing
#   arbitrary arguments to the pkgconfig executable." This could come handy
#   later on when dealing with some of the more annoying dependencies

# TODOs:
#
# - [ ] CMake caches the build and everything, but it does it
#       after running the `./configure`. This produces a lot of
#       unnecessary outputs during the build. I think I can simply
#       and if they exist, ignore the process but that is not perfect!
#       However, since we are not changing these packages so often,
#       we should be fine. Either way, for now I leave it like this.
#
# - [ ] I would love to add these to the ExternalPackage,
#       but CMake proved to be not so good at dealing with a
#       tiniest anomaly/warning that the build process throw
#       at it, and this could cause it to stop the build!

#
# - [ ] I would have liked to choose a better name for _deps but since CPM
#       uses it, I went for it that I don't have to maintain two paths

# Adding caching for CPM, this is going to be useful later that we
# want to have CI builds on GitHub, see here: https://github.com/cpm-cmake/CPM.cmake/wiki/Caching-with-CPM.cmake-and-ccache-on-GitHub-Actions
